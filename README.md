# PFAS-Contamination-Level-Forecasting
This project develops machine learning models to predict PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) contamination levels in U.S. water systems for 2024 using historical data from 2001 to 2023. The project employs time series analysis and machine learning techniques to capture patterns in PFAS contamination.
